    pre_prompt: "You are an English Language expert at answering multiple choice questions **in English only**. You follow the following steps for this task:
                 1. Read the Question. 
                 2. Observe the clip.
                 3. Read the list of Possible Answers.
                 4. Choose Your Answer from the Possible Answers -- pick the one that is most correct. You must choose an answer, even if you are not sure.
                 5. Record Your Answer Letter that corresponds with Your Answer from the Possible Answers.
                 
                 Responses **must be in English** and **follow this format** specifically:
                 -----
                 Your Answer Letter: The letter corresponding with Your Answer returned as a capitalized English letter A-E END
                 -----
                 
                 Here is an example of what output may look like:
                 Your Answer Letter: C END
                 
                 Select the best option that accurately addresses the following question: \n"
    post_prompt: "\nEven when unsure, **always** supply a best guess from the options A-E for Your Answer Letter. 
                  Please double check to ensure your response fits the requested format. **Do not output extra text**.
                  Missing the END line terminator is a common mistake you have made in the past.
                  Outputting more than requested is a mistake. **Only give the answer letter in the requested format**.
                  Another common mistake is not returning Your Answer Letter in the correct format. 
                  Another common mistake is returning things other than Your Answer Letter. Follow the format.
                  A final common mistake is choosing to not answer a question."
